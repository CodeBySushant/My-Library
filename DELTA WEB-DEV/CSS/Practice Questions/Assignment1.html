    <!--Poem-->
    <p>Shelley began writing the poem "<span>Ozymandias</span>" in 1817, upon anticipation of the arrival in Britain of the Younger Memnon, a head-and-torso fragment of a statue of Ramesses II acquired by Italian archaeologist Giovanni Battista Belzoni from the Ramesseum, the mortuary temple of Ramesses II at Thebes.[5] Although the Younger Memnon did not arrive in London until 1821[6][5] the reputation of the statue fragment had preceded its arrival in Western Europe. European attempts to acquire the 7.25-short-ton (6.58 t; 6,580 kg) fragment had been made as early as 1798, when Napoleon's expedition unsuccessfully attempted to retrieve it.[7]</p>
